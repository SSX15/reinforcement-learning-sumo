# Reinforcement Learning + SUMO
Applying reinforcement learning to SUMO for ME-691

## Structure
This project follows the structure of ![FLOW](https://github.com/flow-project/flow) closely. I chose to diverge from flow because it abstracted the XML creation for SUMO. For me, this repository plugs in to a greater code-base, which does lots of preprocessing, turning real-world ITS data into SUMO traffic demand. Those tools work ultimately by writing XML files, and we didn't want to convert to the FLOW pythonic framework.
